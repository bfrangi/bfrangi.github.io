# Background
*Second Year Undergraduate Student at the Carlos III University in Madrid [Dual Bachelor in Engineering Physics and Industrial Technologies Engineering](https://www.uc3m.es/bachelor-degree/physics-industrial)*

I was born in *Zaragoza*, Spain. However, since then I have lived in many different places both in *Spain* (including *Barcelona*, *Lleida* and *Madrid*) and in *England* (including *Sheffield*, *Chesterfield* and *Leeds*). At the age of 9, I relocated with my family to the UK, where I was immersed in a new culture and language. The experience taught me how to quickly adapt to new situations and work with different kinds of people, as well as the invaluable skill of the English language, with which I feel as comfortable as any native.

Five years later, at the age of 14, I moved back to Spain on my own (my family remains to this day in the UK) to study high school in Lleida. During that time I lived at a Student Residence with other people of around my age and attended the *Màrius Torres* high school. Once I finished *Bachillerato* (equivalent to the UK *A-Levels*), with a final score of 10/10 over both years, I moved to Madrid to study a **Dual Bachelor in Engineering Physics and Industrial Technologies Engineering** at the *Carlos III University*. Currently, I am in the second year, and so far I have obtained Honors in six subjects, plus excellent scores in most of the others.

# Key Skills and Qualifications
 
I have participated in several courses, projects and student competitions, gaining valuable skills. These include courses on software tools, such as *LaTeX* and *Excel*, humanities courses on Greek etymology, and official qualifications as kids camp monitor obtained during my leisure time over summers. I was awarded the [Premi Argo](https://www.uab.cat/web/programa-argo/programa-argo-estudiants/estudiants/convocatoria-1345719279744.html) from the *Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona*, and the [Premi a Treballs de Recerca](https://www.udl.cat/ca/serveis/seu/treballsrecerca/) from the *Universitat de Lleida*, both national competitions on the basis of the final research project from High School. I also participated in the [Physics Olympiads](https://blogs.iec.cat/scfis/category/oimpiada/) organised by the Catalan Society of Physics, and won the [Dissabte de les Matemàtiques a Lleida](http://www.eps.udl.cat/ca/agenda/Dissabte-de-les-Matematiques-a-Lleida).

I am the eldest of 8 siblings, so at home I have had plenty of opportunities to develop many skills that are essential for living with and leading others, and essential for teamwork. These include: communication, listening, adaptability, flexibility, cooperation, respect, patience, dispute resolution, dependability, responsibility, interpersonal skills, attentiveness, and many other valuable qualities that one can learn in a large family. I have had the chance to further develop these skills by volunteering as monitor at summer camps in the Pyrenees looking after small children and teenagers.

I am a very quick learner, able to face new tasks and situations independently. In the research project I undertook in my last year of high school, I designed and built a hybrid go-kart. During the project, I learned to face unexpected problems and difficulties, find information on the internet and various other sources, and teach myself the use design software, such as *Fusion 360* (for *3D* design). The people who know me see me as a resourceful person, with a great ability to solve problems effectively, especially when those problems are related to technology or engineering.

Another skill that I have developed a lot during the last few years is programming. I have extensive knowledge of Python and other programming languages, such as HTML and JavaScript. I have experience making websites with *Django* and making mobile applications with *React Native*. Most of this has been self-taught. However, the most important thing that I have gained from this, more than the familiarity with the mentioned programming languages, is the skill of computational thinking: solving problems by breaking them down into simpler algorithmic steps.

All these skills have been key to my success so far, and I am always looking for the opportunity to develop them further, as well as learn new ones that could be useful to me in the future.
