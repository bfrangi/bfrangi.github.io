# Background
*Fourth Year Undergraduate Student at the Carlos III University in Madrid [Dual Bachelor in Engineering Physics and Industrial Technologies Engineering](https://www.uc3m.es/bachelor-degree/physics-industrial)*

I was born in *Zaragoza*, Spain, but my life has been a journey through various places in both *Spain* (including *Barcelona*, *Lleida*, and *Madrid*) and *England* (including *Sheffield*, *Chesterfield*, and *Leeds*). At the age of 9, my family relocated to the UK, exposing me to a new culture and language. This experience honed my adaptability and ability to collaborate with diverse individuals. I became proficient in English, feeling as comfortable as a native speaker.

When I turned 14, I made the decision to return to Spain on my own, while my family remained in the UK. I pursued my high school education at **Màrius Torres** in *Lleida*. Upon completing *Bachillerato* (equivalent to the UK *A-Levels*), with a flawless score of 10/10 over two years, I moved to Madrid to embark on a **Dual Bachelor's program in Engineering Physics and Industrial Technologies Engineering** at *Carlos III University*. I am currently in my fourth year, having earned Honors in approximately 50% of the courses I've undertaken, and achieved excellent scores in most others.

In 2023, my dedication and achievements were formally recognized when I was honored with the **Excellence Award** presented by the *Social Council of Carlos III University*, a testament to my outstanding academic accomplishments and my significant impact on the university community.

# Key Skills and Qualifications
 
I have participated in several courses, projects and student competitions, through which I have gained many valuable skills. These include courses on software tools, such as *Git*, *LaTeX* and *Excel*, humanities courses on Greek etymology, and official qualifications as kids camp monitor obtained during my leisure time over summers. I was awarded the [Premi Argó](https://www.uab.cat/web/programa-argo/programa-argo-estudiants/estudiants/convocatoria-1345719279744.html) from the *Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona*, and the [Premi a Treballs de Recerca](https://www.udl.cat/ca/serveis/seu/treballsrecerca/) from the *Universitat de Lleida*, both national competitions evaluating High School students in research. I also participated in the [Physics Olympiads](https://blogs.iec.cat/scfis/category/oimpiada/) organised by the Catalan Society of Physics, and won the [Dissabte de les Matemàtiques a Lleida](http://www.eps.udl.cat/ca/agenda/Dissabte-de-les-Matematiques-a-Lleida).

As the eldest of 8 siblings, I've had abundant opportunities within my family to cultivate essential life skills, which have subsequently proven immensely valuable in professional settings. These skills, critical for effective teamwork, encompass communication, active listening, adaptability, flexibility, cooperation, respect, patience, conflict resolution, dependability, responsibility, interpersonal skills, attentiveness, and an array of other invaluable qualities—virtues one must inevitably acquire in a large family setting. My commitment to nurturing these attributes extends beyond my family life; I've actively honed these abilities while serving as a camp monitor at summer camps in the Pyrenees, where I cared for both young children and teenagers.

My aptitude for rapid learning and autonomous problem-solving is a defining aspect of my character. In a high school research project, I took on the challenge of designing and constructing a hybrid go-kart, an endeavor that taught me how to confront unforeseen obstacles and navigate through difficulties. I adeptly taught myself to utilize tools such as *Fusion 360* for 3D design, mastering the art of sourcing valuable information from diverse online and offline resources. Those who know me well regard me as a resourceful individual, particularly proficient at resolving issues, especially those related to technology and engineering.

Another sphere where I've made substantial strides is programming. My extensive knowledge encompasses *Python*, *Ruby* and other programming languages like *HTML* and *JavaScript*. I've applied my skills to create websites using *Django* and *Ruby on Rails*, and to develop mobile applications with *React Native*, largely through self-guided learning. Yet, my most significant takeaway from this journey is not solely my command of these programming languages, but rather the cultivation of computational thinking—the art of deconstructing complex problems into manageable, algorithmic steps for resolution.

These proficiencies have been pivotal to my accomplishments thus far, and I remain fervently committed to both refining them and embarking on the acquisition of new skills that hold the potential to benefit not only myself but also others in the future.
