# Background
*Fifth Year Undergraduate Student at the Carlos III University in Madrid [Dual Bachelor in Engineering Physics and Industrial Technologies Engineering](https://www.uc3m.es/bachelor-degree/physics-industrial)*.

I was born in *Zaragoza*, Spain, but my life has been a journey through various places in both *Spain* (including *Barcelona*, *Lleida*, and *Madrid*) and *England* (including *Sheffield*, *Chesterfield*, *Leeds* and *Manchester*). At the age of 9, my family relocated to the UK, exposing me to a new culture and language. This experience honed my adaptability and ability to collaborate with diverse individuals. I became proficient in English, feeling as comfortable as a native speaker.

When I turned 14, I made the decision to continue my studies in Spain, living there during term time while my family stayed behind in the UK. I pursued my high school education at **Màrius Torres** in *Lleida*. Upon completing *Bachillerato* (equivalent to the UK *A-Levels*), with a flawless score of 10/10 over two years, I moved to Madrid to embark on a **Dual Bachelor's program in Engineering Physics and Industrial Technologies Engineering** at *Carlos III University*. I am currently in my fifth year, having earned Honors in approximately 50% of the courses I've undertaken, and achieved excellent scores in most others.

In 2023, my dedication and achievements were formally recognized when I was honored with the **Excellence Award** presented by the *Social Council of Carlos III University*, a testament to my outstanding academic accomplishments and my significant impact on the university community.

# Key Skills and Qualifications

As the eldest of 8 siblings, I have had abundant opportunities within my family to cultivate essential life skills, which have subsequently proven immensely valuable in professional settings. These skills, critical for effective teamwork, encompass communication, active listening, adaptability, flexibility, cooperation, respect, patience, conflict resolution, dependability, responsibility, interpersonal skills, attentiveness, and an array of other invaluable qualities—virtues one must inevitably acquire in a large family setting. My commitment to nurturing these attributes extends beyond my family life; I've actively honed these abilities while serving as a _camp monitor_ at summer camps in the Pyrenees, where I cared for both young children and teenagers.
 
As well as these soft skills, I have developed my technical skills and knowledge through my participation in several [courses](https://bfrangi.github.io/achievements/), [projects](https://bfrangi.github.io/projects/) and student competitions, through which I have gained many valuable skills. These include courses on software tools, such as *Git*, *LaTeX* and *Excel*; humanities courses on Greek etymology; and official qualifications as kids camp monitor obtained during my leisure time over summers. I also participated in the [Physics Olympiads](https://blogs.iec.cat/scfis/category/oimpiada/) organised by the Catalan Society of Physics, and won the [Dissabte de les Matemàtiques a Lleida](http://www.eps.udl.cat/ca/agenda/Dissabte-de-les-Matematiques-a-Lleida). All this, as well as my academic achievements, are a testament to my _commitment to continuous learning and self-improvement_.

I am committed to excellence, striving to make the most of every opportunity to learn and grow. At university, I often go beyond the syllabus in subjects that captivate me, exploring additional books, articles, and videos to deepen my understanding. To solidify my knowledge, I simplify complex concepts and explain them to myself in clear terms. I also enjoy sharing knowledge with others, as seen in the comprehensive notes I created and open-sourced for my [Advanced Quantum Mechanics](https://github.com/bfrangi/advanced-quantum-mechanics-notes) and [Numerical Methods](https://github.com/bfrangi/numerical-methods-notes) courses. These projects reflect my passion for learning, clarity, and collaboration.

<!-- I strive to maintain a balance between my academic and personal life, engaging in a variety of activities that contribute to my personal growth. I am an avid reader, with a particular interest in science fiction and fantasy literature. I am also a passionate musician, having played the guitar for over a decade. I enjoy playing sports, particularly basketball and swimming, and I am an enthusiastic supporter of the *FC Barcelona* football team. I am also a keen traveler, having visited numerous countries in Europe and Asia, and I am always eager to explore new cultures and traditions. -->

 

My aptitude for rapid learning and autonomous problem-solving is a defining aspect of my character. In a high school research project, I took on the challenge of [designing and constructing a hybrid go-kart](https://repositori.udl.cat/server/api/core/bitstreams/5e4e9547-6fcf-4c1a-9bec-ec2b85f8610a/content), an endeavor that taught me how to confront unforeseen obstacles and navigate through difficulties. I taught myself to use tools such as *Fusion 360* for 3D design, mastering the art of sourcing valuable information from diverse online and offline resources. For this project, I was awarded the [Premi Argó](https://www.uab.cat/ca/ice/premi-argo) from the *Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona*, and the [Premi a Treballs de Recerca](https://www.udl.cat/ca/serveis/seu/treballsrecerca/) from the *Universitat de Lleida*, both national competitions evaluating High School students in research. Those who know me well regard me as a resourceful individual, particularly proficient at solving diverse problems, especially those related to technology and engineering.

Another sphere where I've made substantial strides is programming. My extensive knowledge encompasses `Python`, `Ruby` and other programming languages like `HTML` and `JavaScript`. I've applied my skills to create websites using `Django` and `Ruby on Rails`, and to develop mobile applications with `React Native`, largely through self-guided learning. Yet, my most significant takeaway from this journey is not solely my command of these programming languages, but rather the cultivation of *computational thinking*—the art of deconstructing complex problems into manageable, algorithmic steps for resolution.

These proficiencies have been pivotal to my accomplishments thus far, and I remain fervently committed to both refining them and embarking on the acquisition of new skills that hold the potential to benefit not only myself but also others in the future.
